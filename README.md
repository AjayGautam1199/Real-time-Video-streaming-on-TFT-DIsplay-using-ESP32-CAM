# Real-time-Video-streaming-on-TFT-DIsplay-using-ESP32-CAM
This project demonstrates how to stream real-time video from an ESP32 CAM module to a TFT display. The ESP32 CAM is a low-cost microcontroller with an integrated camera and WiFi, making it perfect for IoT projects that require video streaming capabilities.
